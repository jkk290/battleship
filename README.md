# Battleship

Practice test driven development by creating a Battleship app

Will re-visit later to add better styling and take a shot at the extra credit.

Extra credit
Make your battleship project more impressive by introducing any of these modifications.

Implement drag and drop to allow players to place their ships.
Create a 2-player option that lets users take turns by passing the laptop back and forth, or by spinning the monitor around on a desktop. Implement a ‘pass device’ screen so that players don’t see each other’s boards!
Polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.
